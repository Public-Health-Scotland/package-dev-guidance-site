{"title":"Commits vs Tags","markdown":{"headingText":"Commits vs Tags","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\n\nA package based on a Git endpoint can be configured to watch one of two types of changes: \"commits\" or \"tags.\" In short, \"commits\" watches for changes to a specified Git branch, where \"tags\" watches for new tags in the whole Git repository.\n\nCommit mode is recommended for bleeding edge repositories, whereas tag mode is suitable for exposing stable releases of packages.\n\nA Git source can support different packages with different modes. However, a given package can only have one mode in a source. If you would like to surface the same package in both commit and tag mode, you must create two Git sources.\n\n### Commits and Tags Behavior for R Packages\n\n- **Commits**: Package Manager will update the package any time new commits are discovered in a branch. In this mode, Package Manager *automatically modifies the package's version*, assigning a unique version number to each build. The version number is created based on the commit time-stamp and is designed to avoid conflicts with the version scheme used by the package author. For example, if the Description file for a package indicates a version of 1.1-3, the automatic version number would be: `1.1-3.0.0.0.1537204599`. If the author updates the package with a new commit, but keeps the version in the Description file the same, the new automatic version number would reflect the new commit time-stamp, e.g. `1.1-3.0.0.0.1537218677`. This process ensures that users of the package always get the correct behavior from `install.packages()`, with newer commits being associated with a semantically higher version number.\n- **Tags**: Package Manager will update the package any time a new Git tag is discovered. In this mode, Package Manager retains the version specified in the package's Description file. This mode is designed to work when a Git tag is used to indicate a package release. Note: The name of the tag must match the version in the Description file. For example, if your package's Description file has Version: `5.4.2`, your tag must be either `5.4.2` or `v5.4.2`. If two tags reference the same version, preference is given to the newer tag. If a newer tag references an older version than a prior tag, the new tag is built as an archived package. If a tag is removed from a Git endpoint, any packages already built for that tag remain.\n\nCheck if PHS POSIT Package Manager is using tags or commits by searching the package name at
