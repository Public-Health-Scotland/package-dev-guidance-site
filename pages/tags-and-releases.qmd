## Tags and Releases

A tag is a pointer to a specific commit. This pointer can be super charged with some additional information (identity of the creator of the tag, a description, a GPG signature, ...).
A tag is a git concept whereas a Release is GitHub higher level concept.
As stated in the [official announcement post](https://github.blog/2013-07-02-release-your-software/) from the GitHub blog: 

> Releases are first-class objects with changelogs and binary assets that present a full project history beyond Git artifacts.

A Release is created from an existing tag and exposes release notes and links to download the software or source code from GitHub.

    1.	When tagging releases in a version control system, the tag for a version MUST be "vX.Y.Z" e.g. "v3.1.0".
