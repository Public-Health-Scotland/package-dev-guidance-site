## Recommended Git Workflow

- Create a development branch
- `usethis::use_version(x.x.x.9000)` or update DESCRIPTION
- `git add -A`, `git commit -m`, `git push origin dev-branch`, 
- Submit pull request
- Get changes reviewed
- Once changes are approved, the maintainer decides on version major/minor/patch version increment â€“ how to attach tag at this point? Ask developer to commit again with decided version and tag?
- Merge to main branch
